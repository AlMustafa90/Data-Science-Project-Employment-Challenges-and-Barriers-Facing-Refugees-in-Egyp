# Data Science Project: Employment Challenges Facing Refugees in Egypt

## Introduction

This data science project focuses on analyzing the employment challenges faced by refugees in Egypt through both quantitative and qualitative data. The project will explore job unsustainability for employed refugees and the barriers unemployed refugees face when seeking jobs. Additionally, the project will include text analysis of open-ended survey responses, opinions, and comments to gain deeper insights into refugees' personal experiences and challenges in the labor market.

## Project Goals

- Analyze factors contributing to job unsustainability and unsuitability for employed refugees in Egypt.  
- Identify challenges unemployed refugees face during their job search, including job availability, legal restrictions, and discrimination.  
- Explore refugees' personal experiences through text analysis of opinions, comments, and open-ended responses.  
- Measure the average job search duration and explore factors that affect the ability of refugees to secure employment.

## Project Objectives

- Detect patterns and trends related to job unsuitability and instability among employed refugees.  
- Explore key obstacles preventing unemployed refugees from accessing suitable job opportunities.  
- Analyze qualitative data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights.  
- Visualize the relationship between refugees' qualifications and the types of jobs they obtain.  
- Provide data-driven insights to support solutions for improving job access and retention for refugees.

## Dataset Description
The dataset was collected through structured questionnaires targeting:  
including 2006 refugee form 11 different countries.
### Key Features in the Dataset:  
- Demographic Data: Age, gender, education level, country of origin.  
- Employment Status: Employed, unemployed, part-time, or informal work.  
- Job Search Duration: Time spent searching for employment.  
- Job Suitability: Alignment between job roles and qualifications.  
- Work Conditions: Salary, job security, and working environment.  
- Challenges Faced: Legal barriers, discrimination, language barriers, and lack of opportunities.  
- Text Data: Comments, opinions, and responses to open-ended questions.

## Analytical Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
- Preprocess text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant content).  
- Convert categorical data into numerical formats where necessary.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Distribution Analysis: Age, education level, and employment status.  
- Correlation Analysis: Relationship between education and job suitability.  
- Trend Analysis: Job search duration across demographics.  
- Visualization: Use bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent key findings.

### 3. Text Analysis (NLP)  
- Sentiment Analysis: Identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in comments and feedback.  
- Topic Modeling: Discover common themes in open-ended responses using algorithms like LDA.  
- Keyword Extraction: Highlight frequently mentioned words and phrases.  
- Word Clouds: Visualize common concerns and topics in text responses.

### 4. Comparative Analysis  
- Compare challenges between employed and unemployed refugees.  
- Analyze how different factors (education, skills, legal status) impact job sustainability.
ucation, skills, and leeducationgal status) impact job sustainability.

### key foucs
### For Employed Refugees:  
- Suitability of jobs relative to qualifications.  
- Challenges in sustaining long-term employment.  
- Working conditions and opportunities for growth.  
- Sentiment analysis of work experiences.

## Expected Outcomes

- Data-driven insights into employment challenges faced by refugees in Egypt.  
- Sentiment analysis results that reflect refugees' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with job markets.  
- Topic modeling to identify recurring themes in refugees' feedback.  
- Visual representations of the factors affecting job suitability, sustainability, and accessibility.  
- Recommendations for NGOs, policymakers, and employers to improve job opportunities for refugees.

## Next Steps

1. Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess both structured and text data.  
2. Exploratory Analysis: Perform EDA to uncover patterns and trends.  
3. Text Analysis: Apply NLP techniques for deeper insights.  
4. Visualization: Develop visual insights to simplify datable insights for improving employment opportunities and job sustainability for refugees in Egypt.*gees.ch.
